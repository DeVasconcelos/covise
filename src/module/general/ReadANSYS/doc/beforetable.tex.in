% short description what the module does
%

ReadANSYS reads .rst, .rfl, and .rth files, which
are the results files for mechanical,
FLOTRAN or thermal analysis. In all
cases READ\_ANSYS finds dynamically the degrees
of freedom active in the model, from which the user
may choose any option for visualisation. As for derived
data, the module reads stresses and several kinds of strains
for mechanical files, and the heat flux for thermal analysis.
